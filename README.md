======================

An extended version of what I submitted (in C++) for Lonely Planet's coding exercise

Despite agreeing with much of what Adel says on the LP blog (http://engineering.lonelyplanet.com/2014/07/28/How-To-Pass-A-Coding-Test.html) I've added quite a few TODOs. I believe these are useful not only as a reminder to myself but also for anyone who wants to add code later on, and hence *do* form part of what constitutes good code.
