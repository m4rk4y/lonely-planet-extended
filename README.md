lonely-planet-extended
======================

What I submitted for Lonely Planet's coding exercise.

First of all there's my original submission in C++ and a minimally Rubyesque version (also submitted as an afterthought). Then there's my extended version. Then there's the extras that I added on site (or least my reconstruction of those since I didn't take them away). I will also re-implement it in some kind of better Ruby in due course.

Despite agreeing with much of what Adel says on the LP blog (http://engineering.lonelyplanet.com/2014/07/28/How-To-Pass-A-Coding-Test.html) I've still ended up adding quite a few TODOs. I believe these are useful not only as a reminder to myself but also for anyone who wants to add code later on, and hence *do* form part of what constitutes good code.

The eagle-eyed reader will also note the complete absence of test cases at this point. Or indeed any unit-test framework for that matter. Well I'm just trying to get my code in for now.
